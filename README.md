  * Packed with the information, examples, and problems you need to learn to "think like a chemist," CHEMISTRY: AN ATOMS FIRST APPROACH is designed to help you become an independent problem-solver. The text begins with coverage of the atom and proceeds through the concept of molecules, structure, and bonding. This approach, different from your high school course, will help you become a good critical thinker and a strong problem-solver -- skills that will be useful to you in any career.
